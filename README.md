## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned building responsive webpages using media queries. Using (margin:auto;)
properly. Got comfortable with FLEXBOX .

```html
<svg width="85%" height="100%">
                <rect width="100%" height="100%" 
         x="0" y="0" fill=" hsla(178, 100%, 50%,0)"/>
</svg>
```
```css
.main{
    box-shadow:20px 30px hsl(216, 54%, 11%),-20px 30px hsl(216, 54%, 11%),
    50px 50px hsl(217,60%,11%),-50px -50px hsl(217,60%,11%);    
.img-container svg:hover ~ .eye-icon{
    visibility:visible;
}
```

### Continued development
I would like to find new ways to develope hover state for nft image.
